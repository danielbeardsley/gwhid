gwhid
=====

github-what-have-i-done: cli output of the github private events feed.  Github
doesn't provide a browser-friendly means of looking at *all* the events
associated with your account but they do provide an API.  **gwhid** uses that
API to produce a simple text-stream of all the events (public and private
repositories).  This can be very nice for seeing at a glance what you did over
the course of a day.

### Example

    macbook 01:49 ~/projects/gwhid â–¶  node index.js | head -n 30 | cut -c 1-38
